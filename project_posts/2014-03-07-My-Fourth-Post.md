First Experimental installation is now complete, here are some images

The laptops connected over OSC needed a local wifi connection. The Royal academy public wifi brought up some problems so i had to use my NEXUS 5 as a tethering device to connect all the computers together.

The signals were sent from the audio laptop to the ANDROID phone and then forwarded to the projection laptops.
