Here is a little peek at the waveform triangulation program that i built from scratch in cinder. This works behind the scenes and generates outputs that can trigger a multitude of haptic interactions, it can even has an embedded neural network if the system needs more abstract associations between the raw data and the output/sensory experience of the observer. ( this is by no means the finished product and can work in tandem with the other programs and platforms that create the installation )
