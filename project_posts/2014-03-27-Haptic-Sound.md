Accurate Triangulation! Touching, tapping or knocking on the wooden surface creates visibile ripples from the source of the sound. 

(video on vimeo to follow in the next few days)

Whilst the visuals and responses are still relatively primitive (i am still fairly new to Cinder). However, this base framework has a lot of potential to build upon for the final installation at the Barbican. 

The installation will be context sensitive and without knowing the exact site in the gallery i have tried to keep the submission as plastic and adaptable as possible. Where we take it from here relies on the situation and location of the final installation, not to mention the collaboration with Google and Google Tech.

My submission is complete. But the project is far from over...
